# 🌐 Optimising AWS VPC Deployments for Cloud Resources  

## **Project Overview**  
This project dives into **optimising Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setups** in AWS to create **secure, segmented environments** for EC2 instances. I explored **manual and automated** approaches to subnetting, routing, and securing cloud resources using best practices.  

## **Project Highlights**  

### **What I Did:**  
🚀 **Deployed EC2 Instances**  
- Launched a **public EC2 instance** with SSH access secured by a key pair.  
- Created a **private EC2 instance** that only accepts traffic from the public subnet using **security group rules**.  

📈 **Automated VPC Creation**  
- Used the **AWS VPC Resource Map** to streamline and simplify complex VPC deployments.  

🛡️ **Strengthened Network Segmentation & Security**  
- Configured **subnets, route tables, security groups**, and **NAT Gateways** to ensure efficient and safe traffic flow.  

### **Next Steps:**  
📡 **Add Monitoring** – Implement **CloudWatch Logs and Flow Logs** for deeper insight into network behavior.  
🔄 **Explore Auto Scaling** – Integrate auto-scaling EC2 groups for cost-efficient performance and resiliency.  

## **Why This Matters?**  
Understanding how to **secure and automate** cloud networking is essential in today's cloud-first world. This project enhanced my hands-on experience with **AWS VPC**, **EC2**, and **network security fundamentals**, preparing me for real-world infrastructure deployments.
